# Basics Refresher
# You can use R as a calculator
1 / 200 * 30
(59 + 73 +2) / 3
sin(pi / 2)

# You can create new objects with <-:
x <- 3 * 4

# All R statements where you create objects, assignment statements, have the 
# same form:
object_name <- 'value' #when reading that code say “object name gets value” in your head
# Alt + - (the minus sign) = <-

# inspect an object by typings its name
object_name

# make another assignment
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5
